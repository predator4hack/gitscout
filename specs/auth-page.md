# Auth Page setup

## Objective

The objective of this task is to create a separte page for authentication. Curretnly a pop up comes up when we click on sign in button. Instead of that, we need a separate page with sign in options. Keep the page in line with the landing page design and styles.

There should be a logo at the top left corner.

## Implementation Details

Please go through the @README.md to understand the project. Once you are done, please go through the @LandingPage.tsx and understand the design, layouts, fonts and style.

We need to create a signup/login page instead of the popup that we are getting when we click on login button
