# Optimize the user search

## Objective

The current implementation relies on the user search based on the query generated by the LLMs. This needs to be optimized using the methods mentioned below.

## Background

Please go through README.md, specs/brainstorm.md, specs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md and understand the project. Also, look for the query_generator.py, scorer and ranker files for understanding the user search and ranking.

## Implementation details

1. Search repositories and extract contributors - Repo search is great because job requirements map naturally to repo signals:

-   langugage: Python
-   Keywords in README/description
-   topics(kubernetes, grpc, ray, airflow)
-   activity (pushed:>=YYYY-MM-DD) - quality proxy
    Then:
    -   pull contributors for those repos
    -   convert contributors into candidate users

keep only top contributors(by contribution count) to avoid noisy drive-by commits

2. User search as supplemental channel
   Use graphQL queries to directly the users for broader discovery, but expect it to be noisier.
