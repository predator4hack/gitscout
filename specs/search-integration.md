# Search & Processing Integration

## Objective

The objective of this task is to integrate the search in the new landing page, and enable live progress tracking in the processing page, and show results in the dashboard page.

## Implementation Details

I want you to first go through @README.md to understand the project. Once you are done with that, I need you to analyse the old frontend page @SearchApp.tsx. We have to replace the old frontend with the new frontend pages.

Do the following:

- Enable text in the landingPage.tsx in the hero section
- Once the user enters the job description, the user should be redirected to the processing page.
- In the processing page, we should get the live track of the process happening in the background. Please check if there is already a feature built for this in the backend. If not, please build it.
- Once the processing is done, we need to display the results in the @DashboardPage. In each candidate, replace links with email_ids or twitter or linkedin, instead of 'Find Email', 'Reach Out' tags. I believe rest of the information is already available in the API results from the backend.
